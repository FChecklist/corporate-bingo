# Corporate Bingo PARITY MAP with Corporate Tambola (started 2026-10-30)
Status words: ADOPTED (same as Tambola) / ADAPTED (say how) / NOT APPLICABLE (reason from a Bingo rule) / TODO. One row per Tambola feature or combination. Sources: notes 300, 200, 210, compare report data\ui\compare-2026-10-30, Tambola tests. Tambola code: branches wip/join-redesign (live 1.8.3), feat/tambola-1.8.5-empid.
Bingo differences that drive the ADAPTED / NOT APPLICABLE rows: card patterns (Line, Four Corners, X, Frame, Blackout) instead of houses; one card per player; a called-number sheet instead of the housie board; Bingo's own prizes.
