/* Which organizer screens open at /zc. Bingo ships the new screens as OPT-IN (DEFAULT_NEW = false): /zc.html opens the previous screens unless ?flow=new is in the address or this browser remembered "new".
   When the owner approves, ONE change makes the new screens the default: DEFAULT_NEW = true. ?flow=old opens the previous screens and is remembered on this browser; ?flow=new switches back.
   Links only the previous screens understand (demo game, pass, quick start, new game from the card page, cap, do, k = a Host / AI key link, api) always open the previous screens and the choice is NOT stored.
   A game that needs controls the new screens do not have (manual start, host-called numbers, or live right now) also opens the previous screens, not stored.
   It runs first and only puts flow=new or flow=old into the address, so zc.js (previous screens) and pack/zc-flow.js (new screens) are not touched. */
