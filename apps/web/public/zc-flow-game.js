/* What Corporate Bingo tells the shared new organizer flow (pack/zc-flow.js) about itself. The flow holds no game rules: the prize list comes from this game's own table (ZG.PRIZE_HOUSES: Line, Four Corners, X, Frame, Blackout and more).
   Owner rule: hide what Bingo cannot do (no coming soon, no demo stub). So: one card per player, no Super Bumper, no rehearsals, no lucky draw, no next-number control. */
